## Developing

### Committing changes

The [Git flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow/) workflow is used to manage development of this package.

Discrete changes should be made within *feature* branches, created from and merged back into *develop* (where small one-line changes may be made directly).

When ready to release a set of features/changes create a *release* branch from *develop*, update documentation as required and merge into *master* with a tagged, [semantic version](http://semver.org/) (e.g. `v1.2.3`).

After releases the *master* branch should be merged with *develop* to restart the process. High impact bugs can be addressed in *hotfix* branches, created from and merged into *master* directly (and then into *develop*).

### Issue tracking

Issues, bugs, improvements, questions, suggestions and other tasks related to this package are managed through the BAS Web & Applications Team Jira project ([BASWEB](https://jira.ceh.ac.uk/browse/BASWEB)).
